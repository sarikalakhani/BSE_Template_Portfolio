# Obstacle Avoiding Car
Using the Arduino chip and application, I code my robot to not encounter any objects without any remote control.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is testing my ultrasonic sensor. My first step was to learn about how an ultrasonic sensor functions. The sensor emmits ultrasonic sound waves to an object and times the emission and reception of the wave; therefore, the sensor is able to derive the distance from the sensor to the object. After, I was able to code my arduino. My last step was assembly. I connected wires from by sensor to my arduino and the same for my buzzer.
